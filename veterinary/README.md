This is the code of an ongoing project to create an Odoo 11 module for a veterinary clinic management.

It's based on the module veterinary created by Bilal that can be found in the Odoo web (https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/11.0/veterinary/).

It adds to the Bilal module different clinical tests: blood tests, radiology, echography and citology, and some different views for appointments
